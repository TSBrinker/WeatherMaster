# Archived Documentation

These documents contain historical information from earlier sprints. They've been archived because:
- Their content was duplicated across multiple files
- They became stale and weren't being maintained
- Key information has been extracted to active documents

## What's Here

| `QUESTIONS_FOR_USER.md` | Early architectural Q&A with Tyler's decisions | Reference for why certain decisions were made |
| `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Original agent instructions + session-by-session notes | Historical reference, session details |
