# Welcome to WeatherMaster Development

## Your First Steps (Do These In Order)

### 1. Choose Your Name
Pick a **unique** name for yourself! Check the list below for names already taken. Early agents chose tree/nature names (Elderwood, Willow, Cedar, Granite, Obsidian...) but you're welcome to break tradition. **Once you've chosen, add your name to the list below** and introduce yourself to Tyler.

#### Names Already Taken
> ALDER, ASH, BASALT, BIRCH, BROOK, CEDAR, CINDER, COBALT, CORAL, COVE, CYPRESS, DRIFT, ELDERWOOD, EMBER, FERN, FLINT, GRANITE, HAWTHORN, HEMLOCK, JUNIPER, LARCH, MAPLE, MARBLE, OAK, OBSIDIAN, ONYX, OPUS, PINE, QUARTZ, RIDGE, RIVER, ROWAN, SAGE, SEQUOIA, SHALE, SLATE, SPRUCE, STONE, SUMMIT, TERRA, VALE, WILLOW

### 2. Create Your Sprint Log
Create `docs/sprint-logs/SPRINT_XX_YOURNAME.md` immediately (XX = next number).
Check existing logs to find the current count. Document as you work.

### 3. Read Current Context
- **[HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md)** - What the last agent was working on, what to do next
- **[NOTES_FROM_USER.md](NOTES_FROM_USER.md)** - Tyler's scratchpad (check for new items!)

### 4. Understand the Project (As Needed)
- **[WORKING_WITH_TYLER.md](WORKING_WITH_TYLER.md)** - Preferences, philosophy, established decisions
- **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** - Feature roadmap and priorities
- **Recent sprint logs** in `sprint-logs/` - What predecessors accomplished
- **[../README.md](../README.md)** - Project overview and features

---

## When You're Done

1. Update your sprint log with everything you did
2. Check NOTES_FROM_USER.md for any unaddressed items
3. **Overwrite HANDOFF.md** with current status for the next agent
4. Commit and push (only when Tyler asks)
5. Give Tyler a quick recap

## Quick Reference

| Need to know... | Read... |
|-----------------|---------|
| What to work on next | HANDOFF.md |
| Tyler's preferences | WORKING_WITH_TYLER.md |
| Feature roadmap | ROADMAP.md |
| How something was built | sprint-logs/ |
| Project features/architecture | README.md |
| Test the app | `npm start`, then `localhost:3000?test=true` for test harness |

## Important: What to Update vs. What to Preserve

| Document | Update Content? | Overwrite Structure? |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| HANDOFF.md | **Yes** - Overwrite entirely each sprint | N/A (no fixed structure) |
| Your sprint log | **Yes** - Add your work | N/A (your document) |
| WORKING_WITH_TYLER.md | **Add** new observations | **No** - Keep existing sections |
| ROADMAP.md | **Update** task status | **No** - Keep category structure |
| START_HERE.md | **Add your name** to the taken list | **No** - Tyler maintains structure |
