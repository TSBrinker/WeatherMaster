Here is where I'll stow some thoughts so I don't interrupt you while you're working. Once you've acknowledged a note, please migrate it to the appropriate place and delete it here (do not delete these instructions, please). This is how I know that the notes have been read/incorporated.

- Currently, the polar region extends 1500 miles from the center. I'm thinking the first 500 is the magical twilight lands, which could probably just be its own fixed instance in the manager. This would leave Polar being 500-1500 miles, rather than starting at 0. - confirm, has this been implemented? if so, remove please :)
- Biomes suggested by slate - For other bands: 4. Humid Subtropical (in subtropical) - the American South, Tokyo, Buenos Aires - hot humid summers, mild winters 5. Steppe (could go temperate or subtropical) - semi-arid grassland, drier than prairie
- Noting for future that the actual interaction of the slide over menu, and then the settings menu pushing that menu down, gets a little weird. May be worth reconsidering.
- We'll want to put some things in a preferences menu. Phrasing and future addition of unit switching (c/f, miles/km) but if it's just those 2-3 things then it's probably not worth its own menu.
- Maybe it can be like:

[Edit Locations]
[Preferences]
(units, phrasing, snow accumulation, light or dark theme maybe)
[Help & Resources] (weather primer, mechanics)
[Manage Data]
(clear cache, nuke, export/import, etc.)

- Stretch goal: more than one world per user. For DMs who run multiple games if they wanna use it for multiple instances

- gotta be a way to edit the world name or whatever else would come along with that.

- Maybe add <<< & >>> buttons to the time controls to jump a full day? And those should maybe be juuuuust a little bigger. Hard on a phone screen to hit the small hitbox.

- No way to edit existing locations, continents, or worlds (fix typos, rename, reassign locations to different continents, etc.) - needs CRUD UI

- Special biomes (Mountain Microclimate, Geothermal Zone, Convergence Zone, Rain Shadow, Coastal Desert) don't appear in the location creation modal

- Consider a dedicated 'create location' modal triggered from the app (discuss specifics later)
