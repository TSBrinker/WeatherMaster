Here is where I'll stow some thoughts so I don't interrupt you while you're working. Once you've acknowledged a note, please migrate it to the roadmap and delete it here (do not delete these instructions, please)

- The clear skies icon should show a moon instead of a sun outside of daylight hours
- The precipitation box in the ConditionsCard has one fewer line of text than the others, and so is the only one that's a different size. Going forward, collections of displays like that should be standardized, instead of adapting to 
- Possible to regen seed? If I'm starting my game, and there in x region on this date, but I don't really want to start in the rain, can the seed be re-rolled? How does that work?
