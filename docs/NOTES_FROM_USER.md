Here is where I'll stow some thoughts so I don't interrupt you while you're working. Once you've acknowledged a note, please migrate it to the roadmap and delete it here (do not delete these instructions, please)

- I have a generated map of the continent that I'm going to be placing locations on. I'm wondering about the ability to upload that map, declare its scale, use that to set. It's overall distance from the center. (like how many miles between the center of the map and the top of the image) and then overlay a visual of where the climate bands would land. And then be able to place pins on that map . Based on the pin location, it would offer options for what biomes exist in that latitude band. Like, a pin within the temperate zone would automatically pull up either temperate or special biomes.
