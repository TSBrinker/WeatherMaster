# Workstation Setup Guide

## When Setting Up on a New Computer

After cloning the repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages including Vite, React, and other dependencies.

### 2. Verify Installation
Check that there are no missing dependencies:
```bash
npm list --depth=0
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

The app should open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

### 4. Build for Production (optional)
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory.

## Build Tool Migration (Dec 2025)

**Note:** This project was migrated from Create React App to Vite in December 2025.

- **Old:** Used `react-scripts` (no longer maintained, had security vulnerabilities)
- **New:** Uses Vite (faster, modern, actively maintained, zero vulnerabilities)

If you're coming from an older clone of this repository, you may need to:
1. Delete your `node_modules` folder
2. Run `npm install` to get the new dependencies
3. The dev server now starts much faster and has better hot module reloading

## Common Issues

### Missing Dependencies
If you see "UNMET DEPENDENCY" errors, run:
```bash
npm install
```

### Git Revert in Progress
If `git status` shows you're in the middle of a revert operation:
```bash
git revert --abort
```

### Port 3000 Already in Use
If the dev server can't start because port 3000 is in use, either:
- Stop the other process using port 3000
- Or modify `vite.config.js` to use a different port

## Project Structure
- `/src` - React application source code
- `/public` - Static assets (favicon, manifest, etc.)
- `/build` - Production build output (generated by `npm run build`)
- `index.html` - Entry HTML file (at root for Vite)
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration
